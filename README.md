You have been assigned to create an interactive data visualization based on the developers salary data from JetBrains Developer Ecosystem Survey 2024. 

Use the following [Figma design ](https://www.figma.com/design/pmxb4N3i62YgFVzE5Nq74b/IT-Salary-Calculator?node-id=0-1&p=f) (password AirRPP_homework2025) and this [reference page](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/devecosystem-it-salary-calculator/) to implement this visualization with working filters. Use `calculatorData.json` as data for visualization. You can use any frontend framework for this task. The data can be either stored as a static file, or served via your own API (or via any other method). Include README on how to set up the project and run the application.
